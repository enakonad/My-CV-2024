    <h2>Achievements</h2>
    <p>I am most proud of the work I have done building LoudElephant from an idea into a well presented and successful eCommerce trader.</p>
    <p>I take great care over the way the business is presented online and have personally developed the quality of the photography, the product listings, the product itself, the logo and branding, our customer service strategy and practically every other aspect of the online business, as well as many parts of the wider organisation.</p>
    <p>Although I have loved building LoudElephant into what it is today, I have a need to develop myself further and I want to see what I can learn in another work environment.</p>
    <p>I am also very proud of my ability to take almost any task, no matter how daunting, break it down, teach myself what I need to know and create a coherent solution.</p>
